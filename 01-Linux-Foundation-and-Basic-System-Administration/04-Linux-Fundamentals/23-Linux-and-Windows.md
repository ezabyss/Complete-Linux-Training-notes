# Linux vs Windows Command-Line Basics

---

# ❓ Why Learn Windows Commands in a Linux Course?

You might think:

> “If I’m learning Linux, why should I care about Windows?”

Because in real-world IT environments:

- You may transfer files between Linux and Windows
- You may troubleshoot hybrid systems
- Many corporate environments use both
- Some tasks require Windows tools

Even if Linux dominates servers, Windows dominates desktops.

A good system administrator understands both.

# 🖥 Linux vs Windows Philosophy

| Linux | Windows |
|--------|----------|
| Terminal-focused | GUI-focused |
| Lightweight | GUI consumes more memory |
| Highly scriptable | Improving command-line support |
| Common in servers | Common in desktops |

Linux is powerful because it relies heavily on command-line operations.

Windows has a command prompt (CMD) and PowerShell, but historically focused on GUI.

# 📌 Common Command Comparisons

| Task | Linux Command | Windows Command |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| List files | `ls -l` | `dir` |
| Clear screen | `clear` | `cls` |
| Copy file | `cp` | `copy` |
| Move/Rename file | `mv` | `move` / `ren` |
| Delete file | `rm` | `del` |
| Compare files | `diff` | `fc` |
| Search in file | `grep` | `find` |
| Show current directory | `pwd` | `cd` or `chdir` |
| Get help | `man command` | `command /?` |
| Show date/time | `date` | `time` / `date` |

# 🧪 Practical Examples

## 1️⃣ List Directory

Linux:

    ls -l

Windows:

    dir

---

## 2️⃣ Clear Screen

Linux:

    clear

Windows:

    cls

---

## 3️⃣ Get Help

Linux:

    man ls

Windows:

    dir /?

---

## 4️⃣ Show Current Directory

Linux:

    pwd

Windows:

    cd

or

    chdir

---

## 5️⃣ Compare Two Files

Linux:

    diff file1 file2

Windows:

    fc file1 file2

---

## 6️⃣ Search for a Word in File

Linux:

    grep error log.txt

Windows:

    find "error" log.txt

# ⚡ Performance Perspective

GUI:
- Uses more memory
- Requires graphical resources
- Slower for automation

Command-line:
- Lightweight
- Script-friendly
- Faster for repetitive tasks
- Ideal for servers

This is why Linux dominates:

- Web servers
- Cloud systems
- Enterprise applications
- DevOps environments

---

# 🧠 Real-World Advice

If you work in IT:

- You WILL encounter Windows systems.
- You WILL transfer files between OS types.
- You SHOULD understand basic command differences.

Linux knowledge + Windows familiarity = Stronger engineer.

---

# 🎯 Final Thought

Windows is powerful for end users.  
Linux is powerful for system control.

Both have strengths.

But in server and enterprise environments,  
Linux usually wins because of performance and flexibility.
