# `wc` Command — Word / Line / Byte Counter 

---

## Why `wc` matters
As a security analyst, you’ll constantly count things like:
- number of log entries that match a keyword
- number of users in a file
- number of events produced by a command
- file size (roughly) using bytes

`wc` = quick counting tool.

---

## What `wc` does
`wc` reads **a file** or **standard input** and reports:

- **lines**
- **words**
- **bytes**

---

## Help / Options
`wc --help`  
`man wc`

---

# Core Syntax

### Count a file
`wc employee-list.txt`

### Count output from a command
`ls -l | wc -l`

---

# The Most Useful Options

| Option | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-l` | lines |
| `-w` | words |
| `-c` | bytes |

> Note: Some people mistakenly use `-b` for bytes, but on many systems `wc` uses `-c` for bytes.

# Practice File: `employee-list.txt`

(Your CSV file with header + employees)

---

## 1) Full report (lines, words, bytes)
`wc employee-list.txt`

Example output format:
`<lines> <words> <bytes> employee-list.txt`

---

## 2) Only line count
`wc -l employee-list.txt`

Use this when you want:
- how many rows/log lines exist
- quick “how big is this file” check (in lines)

---

## 3) Only word count
`wc -w employee-list.txt`

Good for:
- rough content volume
- text-heavy files (notes, logs, reports)

---

## 4) Only byte count
`wc -c employee-list.txt`

Good for:
- checking file size quickly
- verifying if output changed after a command

---

# `wc` with Pipes (Most Real-World Use)

## 5) Count how many files exist in a directory (simple)
`ls | wc -l`

This avoids the “total” line problem that happens with `ls -l`.

---

## 6) If you use `ls -l`, avoid wrong counts
`ls -l | wc -l`

This counts one extra line because `ls -l` includes the `total ...` line.

✅ Better:
`ls -l | tail -n +2 | wc -l`

Explanation:
- `tail -n +2` removes the first line (`total ...`)
- then `wc -l` counts real entries

---

## 7) Count only directories (clean + accurate)
Best way:
`find . -maxdepth 1 -type d | wc -l`

If you want to exclude the current directory `.`:
`find . -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name . | wc -l`

---

## 8) Count only files (not directories)
`find . -maxdepth 1 -type f | wc -l`

---

# `wc` + `grep` (SOC-style counting)

## 9) Count matching lines in a file
Example: count IT employees
`grep ",IT," employee-list.txt | wc -l`

Example: count Finance employees
`grep ",Finance," employee-list.txt | wc -l`

---

## 10) Count matches but ignore header row
`tail -n +2 employee-list.txt | grep ",IT," | wc -l`

---

# Bonus: Counting “unique” things

## 11) How many unique districts?
`cut -d, -f5 employee-list.txt | tail -n +2 | sort | uniq | wc -l`

Flow:
- `cut` gets District column
- `tail -n +2` skips header
- `sort | uniq` removes duplicates
- `wc -l` counts unique values

---

# Quick Cheat Sheet (Most used)
`wc file.txt` → lines + words + bytes  
`wc -l file.txt` → line count  
`wc -w file.txt` → word count  
`wc -c file.txt` → byte count  
`command | wc -l` → count output lines  
`grep "pattern" file | wc -l` → count matching lines  

---

## One-line memory trick
`-l` = lines  
`-w` = words  
`-c` = bytes (size)
