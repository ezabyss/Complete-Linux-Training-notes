# 🐧 CentOS vs CentOS Stream

This topic creates a lot of confusion:
- What is **CentOS Stream**?
- Is **CentOS dead**?
- Should we still learn CentOS?
- Is there still support?

Let’s clear everything **once and for all** — simply and precisely.

## 🧠 What Is CentOS?

**CentOS (Community ENTerprise Operating System)** is a **community-driven enterprise Linux OS**.

- Built by volunteers
- Free to use
- Designed to be **binary-compatible with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)**

📌 In simple words:  
> **CentOS = Free version of RHEL (historically)**

---

## 📜 Brief History of CentOS

### 🗓️ 2004 — Birth of CentOS
- Created by **Greg Kurtzer**
- Built using **RHEL source code**
- Since RHEL is open source, its code was legally reused
- Same functionality, different branding → **CentOS**

### 🌍 Community Growth
- Volunteers worldwide contributed
- CentOS became widely adopted in enterprises

### 🟥 2014 — Red Hat Acquires CentOS
- Red Hat officially took over CentOS
- CentOS became **1:1 compatible with RHEL**
- Used heavily in corporate environments

📌 At this point:
> RHEL = Paid  
> CentOS = Free (same behavior)

---

## 🔄 How Updates Worked (Before 2021)

### ❗ Old Model (Classic CentOS)
> Fedora → RHEL → CentOS


- **Fedora**: Innovation & testing
- **RHEL**: Stable enterprise OS
- **CentOS**: Free downstream clone of RHEL

📌 CentOS received updates **after** RHEL  
➡️ This made CentOS a **downstream** project

---

## 🚨 What Changed in February 2021?

Red Hat changed the model.

### ✅ New Model (CentOS Stream)
> Fedora → CentOS Stream → RHEL

- **CentOS Stream now sits between Fedora and RHEL**
- RHEL is built **from CentOS Stream**
- Updates flow **from CentOS Stream to RHEL**

📌 This makes CentOS Stream an **upstream** project

---

## 🆚 Classic CentOS vs CentOS Stream

| Feature | Classic CentOS | CentOS Stream |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| Status | Discontinued | Active |
| Position | Downstream of RHEL | Upstream of RHEL |
| Update Flow | RHEL → CentOS | CentOS → RHEL |
| Stability | Extremely stable | Slightly ahead of RHEL |
| Purpose | Free RHEL clone | RHEL development preview |

---

## ❓ Is CentOS Dead?

❌ **Classic CentOS Linux is discontinued**  
✅ **CentOS Stream is alive and supported**

So:
> CentOS is **not dead** — it has **evolved**

---

## 🎯 Should You Learn CentOS Stream?

### ✅ YES — Absolutely

Why?
- CentOS Stream is **very close to RHEL**
- Skills transfer directly to **enterprise Linux jobs**
- Used to prepare future RHEL releases
- One of the **best free enterprise-style Linux options**

📌 Learning Linux matters more than the flavor — and **CentOS Stream is still enterprise Linux**.

---

## 🆕 Current Version

- **CentOS Stream 9** → Latest version (as of now)

---

## 🧠 Memory Trick (Very Important)

- **Before 2021** → CentOS followed RHEL  
- **After 2021** → RHEL follows CentOS Stream  

📌 *CentOS Stream is now upstream, not downstream.*

---

## 🏁 Final Takeaway

> CentOS Stream is not a replacement for CentOS Linux —  
> it is the **development bridge between Fedora and RHEL**.

If your goal is:
- Enterprise Linux
- Corporate IT
- System administration

👉 **CentOS Stream is still a great choice to learn Linux.**
