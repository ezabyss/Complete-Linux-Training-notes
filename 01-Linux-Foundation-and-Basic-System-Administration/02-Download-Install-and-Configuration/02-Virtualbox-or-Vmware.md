## Why I Chose VMware Over VirtualBox (As of 2026)

Both VMware Workstation Player and VirtualBox are excellent virtualization tools.  
However, after hands-on use and comparison, VMware has a few practical advantages **for learning Linux and system administration**.

### ✅ Better Performance & Stability
- VMware generally provides **smoother VM performance**
- Better CPU and memory handling, especially on Windows hosts
- Fewer random crashes during long lab sessions

### ✅ Stronger Hardware Compatibility
- Better support for:
  - Newer CPUs
  - Network adapters
  - USB devices
- Linux guest OS detection and optimization works more reliably

### ✅ Cleaner Networking Experience
- NAT and bridged networking work more consistently
- Fewer manual fixes required for internet access inside the VM
- Helpful for:
  - Server labs
  - SSH practice
  - Networking topics

### ✅ More Polished User Experience
- Cleaner UI
- Easier VM creation flow
- Less friction for beginners setting up their first Linux VM

### ✅ Widely Used in Enterprise Environments
- VMware is heavily used in **corporate and enterprise IT**
- Learning VMware aligns well with:
  - Data centers
  - System admin roles
  - Cloud & virtualization concepts

### ⚖️ Important Note (Fair Comparison)

VirtualBox is still a **great tool**, especially because:
- It is fully open source
- It works well on macOS and Linux
- It’s perfectly fine for most learning purposes

👉 **There is no wrong choice.**  
What matters is consistency and practice.

### 🎯 Final Thought

I chose **VMware** because it:
- Feels more stable for long Linux labs
- Matches enterprise environments better
- Requires fewer workarounds during practice

Use **whatever keeps you learning without friction**.

### VirtualBox or VMware — Your Choice

Both **VirtualBox** and **VMware Workstation Player** are reliable virtualization tools.  
There is no “best” option — choose the one that feels comfortable to you.

## Do Your Own Research
