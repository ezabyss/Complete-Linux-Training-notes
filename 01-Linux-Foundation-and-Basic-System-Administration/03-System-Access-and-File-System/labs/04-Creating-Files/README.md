# 📘 Linux File & Directory Operations Lab

## 🧪 Lab Overview
This lab focuses on practicing essential Linux file and directory operations using the command line.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
By completing this lab, I'll be able to:

- Create files using different Linux commands
- Copy files and verify their contents
- Edit files using the `vi` editor
- Create multiple files with a single command
- Create directories, including nested directories
- Understand Linux permission restrictions in system directories

---

## 🛠️ Environment
- Operating System: Centos
- Shell: Bash
- Working Directory: `~/labs/linux-file-ops`

---

## 📋 Lab Tasks
1. Create files using `touch`
2. Create files using `cp`
3. Create a file using `vi`
4. Create multiple files in one command
5. Create directories using `mkdir`
6. Attempt to create a file inside `/etc` and observe the permission error

---

## 🧾 Commands Practiced
- `pwd`
- `ls -l`
- `touch`
- `cp`
- `echo`
- `vi`
- `mkdir`

---

## 🔐 Key Learnings
- Linux provides multiple ways to create files depending on the use case
- `cp` duplicates both file structure and content
- `vi` allows file creation and editing directly from the terminal
- Multiple files and directories can be created efficiently with a single command
- System directories like `/etc` are protected and require elevated privileges
- Permission errors are expected behavior and part of Linux security

---

## 📸 Evidence
All screenshots of command execution and error messages are stored in the `evidence/` directory for verification.

---

## 🚀 Why This Lab Is Important
Linux file operations are fundamental skills required for:
- Security Operations Center (SOC) roles
- Penetration testing labs
- Cloud and server management
- Incident response and forensics

Mastering these basics makes advanced Linux concepts much easier to learn.
