## 🧠 Operating System in Simple Words

An **Operating System (OS)** is a **bridge (middleman)** between:

- 👤 **User (You)**
- 🧠 **Software (Applications)**
- ⚙️ **Hardware (CPU, memory, disk, keyboard, screen)**

You **never talk directly to hardware**.  
The operating system does that **on your behalf**.

---

## 🔄 How an Operating System Works (Real-Life Flow)

1. You press a key on the **keyboard**
2. The **Operating System** understands your request
3. The OS communicates with **hardware**
4. Hardware performs the task
5. The OS shows the **output on the screen**

📌 Without an OS, the computer is just **lifeless hardware**.

## 🎯 Key Functions of an Operating System

An OS is responsible for:

- Providing a **User Interface (UI)**
- Managing **CPU, memory, storage**
- Controlling **hardware devices**
- Allowing **software applications to run**
- Acting as a **communication layer** between user and hardware
