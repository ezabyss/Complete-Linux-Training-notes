## 🧠 Why Linux Is Everywhere (Concept Clarity)

Linux dominates real-world systems because it is:

- ✅ **Stable** – rarely crashes  
- ✅ **Secure** – strong permission model  
- ✅ **Scalable** – runs on 1 device or millions  
- ✅ **Open-Source** – customizable and cost-effective  
- ✅ **Embedded-Friendly** – perfect for hardware systems  

That’s why Linux is preferred in:
- Servers
- Embedded devices
- Networking equipment
- Cloud infrastructure
- Automotive & IoT systems
