# 🐧 What Is Linux? & History of Linux

**what it is**, **why it exists**, and **how it evolved**.

---

## 🧠 What Is Linux? 

**Linux is a free and open-source operating system.**

Let’s break that down:

### ✅ Free
- You can **download, install, and run Linux without paying any money**
- Some companies charge **only for enterprise support**, not for Linux itself

### ✅ Open Source
- The **source code is publicly available**
- Anyone can **view, modify, and distribute** it
- You can customize Linux based on your application needs

📌 Linux is similar to Windows and macOS in purpose,  
but **very different in philosophy and design**.

---

## ⭐ Why Linux Is Popular

Linux is widely known for:

- 🔒 **Security**
- 🧱 **Stability**
- 🔄 **Flexibility**
- ⚙️ **Customization**
- 🌍 **Community-driven development**

Because Linux is open source, a **global community** contributes to improving it.

---

## 🧩 Linux Distributions 

Linux can be modified and redistributed by anyone.

➡️ This resulted in many versions called **Linux distributions (distros)**  
➡️ Each distro is designed for **different purposes**

📌 *We will study distributions in detail later.*

## 🖥️ Linux as an Operating System (Real-Life Understanding)

### Without an OS:
- A computer is just **hardware**
- It is like a **brick** 🧱

### With Linux Installed:
1. You attach an ISO image (modern replacement for DVDs)
2. Linux installation starts
3. Configuration is completed
4. System welcomes you: **“Welcome to Linux”**

Now:
- Keyboard & mouse send commands to Linux
- Linux communicates with hardware
- Hardware performs the action

📌 **Linux acts as the bridge between user commands and hardware execution**

---

## ⌨️ Command-Line Power of Linux

- Linux is **command-line focused**
- Most servers **do not use GUI**
- Command-line offers:
  - Faster execution
  - Automation
  - Better control
  - Stronger security

📌 Linux is popular **because of its command line**, not graphics.

# 🕰️ History of Linux 
---

## 🧱 Before Linux: UNIX (1970)

- Developed at **AT&T Bell Labs**
- Created by **Ken Thompson & Dennis Ritchie**
- Introduced revolutionary OS concepts
- ❌ Proprietary (not freely available)

📌 UNIX inspired Linux, but was **not open source**

---

## 🛠️ GNU Project (1983)

- Started by **Richard Stallman**
- Goal: Create a **free Unix-like OS**
- Developed many tools & utilities
- ❌ Missing one key part → **Kernel**

📌 GNU had tools, but no kernel

---

## 🐧 Birth of Linux (1991)

- Created by **Linus Torvalds**, a 21-year-old student from Finland
- Started as a **hobby project**
- Announced on **August 25, 1991**
- Famous quote:
  > *“I am doing a free operating system. Just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like GNU.”*

## 🧪 Early Linux Versions

| Version | Year | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 0.01 | Sept 1991 | Non-functional, shared for feedback |
| 0.02 | 1991 | Functional kernel + GNU tools |

📌 Linux kernel + GNU utilities = **Complete OS**

This is why some call it **GNU/Linux**

## 📈 Growth & Evolution of Linux

### Early 1990s
- Internet collaboration accelerated development
- First distros appeared:
  - Slackware
  - Debian

### 1994
- Linux **1.0 released**
- ~176,000 lines of code

### Late 1990s
- Commercial adoption increased
- Companies like:
  - Red Hat
  - SUSE
- Linux became **enterprise-ready**

---

## 🌍 Linux in the 2000s

- Adopted in:
  - Embedded systems
  - Supercomputers
  - Servers
- Became the **default choice for infrastructure**

---

## 📱 Android & Linux (2007)

- Google released **Android**
- Based on **Linux kernel**
- Gave Linux massive reach in mobile devices

📌 Billions of devices now run Linux indirectly

---

## 🌐 Linux Today

Linux now powers:
- Smartphones
- Servers
- Cloud platforms
- Supercomputers
